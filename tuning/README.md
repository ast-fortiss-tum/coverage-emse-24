# Parameter Tuning

We report here the results on the paramater tuning for NSGA-II-D and MOPSO from the MNIST and AVP case study.

# Parameter Variation NSGA-II-D

We have tried different archive threshold values t1, t2, as well as different archive insertion strategies BULK and SEQUENTIAL. 
SEQUENTIAL means that all individuals are added immediately to the archive if they meet the inclusion requirement, while BULK means that only after all individuals of a population are processed they are added.
The results are given in Figures X and Y.

# Parameter Variation OMOPSO

For OMOPSO we have varied the size of inds in the crowding distance archive, as well as different boundary handling approaches for individuals. Results are shown in Figure X and Y.
